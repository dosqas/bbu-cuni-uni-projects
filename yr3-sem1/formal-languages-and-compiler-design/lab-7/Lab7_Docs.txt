Grammar Parser Documentation

Overview
This parser implements a recursive descent parsing algorithm with LL(1) parsing table construction for context-free grammars. It supports building parse trees and performing syntax analysis on input sequences.

File Structure

1. Input Files Required

Lab7_SeminarGrammar.txt      Simple test grammar
Lab7_SeminarSequence.txt     Test input sequence
Lab7_MiniDSLGrammar.txt      Complex grammar for Mini DSL
Lab7_MiniDSLPIF.txt          Tokenized input for Mini DSL


2. Output
- Parse tree structure printed as a table
- Production rule sequence during parsing
- Conflict detection in parsing table

Grammar File Format

- Grammar Definition Syntax

N = S A B C D                           Non-terminals (space-separated)
E = + * a ( )                           Terminals (space-separated)
S = S                                   Start symbol
P =                                     Production rules start
S -> B A                                Production: Left -> Right
A -> + B A                              Multiple symbols allowed
A -> epsilon                            Empty production

Key Features
- Case-sensitive symbol names
- `epsilon` represents empty string
- Auto-detects terminals from productions
- Maintains order of productions for parsing

Core Components

1. Grammar Loading (`load_grammar_from_file`)
- Parses grammar definition files
- Extracts: NONTERMINALS, TERMINALS, STARTSYMBOL, PRODUCTIONS
- Auto-adds terminals from production rules
- Maintains ordered productions for reference

2. First Set Computation (`generate_first`)
- Computes FIRST sets for all non-terminals
- Handles epsilon productions
- Uses iterative fixed-point algorithm

3. Follow Set Computation (`generate_follow`)
- Computes FOLLOW sets using FIRST sets
- Special handling for start symbol ($)
- Considers right-hand context in productions

4. Parsing Table Construction (`build_parsing_table`)
- Builds LL(1) parsing table
- Detects and reports conflicts
- Maps (non-terminal, terminal) pairs to production indices

5. Parser (`parse`)
- Uses stack-based parsing algorithm
- Accepts tokenized input sequence
- Returns sequence of production indices
- Error reporting for invalid input

6. Parse Tree Construction (`build_tree`)
- Builds abstract syntax tree from production sequence
- Uses recursive descent construction
- Node structure with parent/child relationships

7. Tree Display (`print_tree_table`)
- Prints parse tree in tabular format
- Shows: Index, Symbol, Father, Sibling
- Breadth-first traversal

Error Handling

1. Grammar Conflicts
- Detected during table construction
- Reported as: `[CONFLICT] Table[non_term, term] has X vs Y`
- Program continues but indicates conflicts exist

2. Parsing Errors
- Invalid token detection
- Stack mismatch reporting
- Expected tokens display

3. File Errors
- Missing files handled gracefully
- Invalid format detection
