This program inputs a csv of foods which have fields for their calories, country of origin and name. First we filter them to only keep foods having calories greater than 750, followed by grouping them by country, sorting them, and outputting the foods if we have more than 10 countries where we have foods from. We then iterate over the food, and we output the name and the calories of the foods that have more than 1500 or less than 1000 calories.

input food from "food.csv"
filter food where calories > 750
group food by country
sort food asc
if count(food) > 10
  output food
end

for f in food
  if f.calories > 1500 or f.calories < 1000
    if len(f.name) > 10
      output f.name
      output f.calories
    end	
  end
