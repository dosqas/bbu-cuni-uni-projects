The GenAI I used is ChatGPT using GPT-5.
For problem 1, he showed me that my dataset definition was wrong, since I put the numbers as a quoted string. According to my BNF, numbers do not have quotes, so he was right.

Problem: 
dataset cities = [
  {"name": "Falticeni", "population": "30000"}
  {"name": "Ludus", "population": "17000"}
  {"name": "Boholt", "population": "5000"}
  {"name": "Tandarei", "population": "32000"}
]

Fix: 
dataset cities = [
  {"name": "Falticeni", "population": 30000}
  {"name": "Ludus", "population": 17000}
  {"name": "Boholt", "population": 5000}
  {"name": "Tandarei", "population": 32000}
]



For the second problem, once again I had a small issue, particularly when I tried to output a field. According to my BNF I can only output id's, so he was once again right. I fixed it by extending the language to allow the output of specific fields.

Problem: 
<output> ::= "output" <id> ["to" <string>]


Fix: 
<output> ::= "output" (<id> | <field>) ["to" <string>]


Another issue he pointed to was not a syntactic issue, but rather a logic one. Since f is a single record it makes no sense to use max(f.calories) and min(f.calories)

Problem: 
  if max(f.calories) > 1500 or min(f.calories) < 1000
    ...
  end

Fix:
  if f.calories > 1500 or f.calories < 1000
    ...
  end

This program takes a dataset of cities, filters them to get rid of cities with less than 20000 people living in it, sorting them in a descending order, followed by selecting their name and outputting them. (to the console, since we do not specify a path to output to)

dataset cities = [
  {"name": "Falticeni", "population": "30000"}
  {"name": "Ludus", "population": "17000"}
  {"name": "Boholt", "population": "5000"}
  {"name": "Tandarei", "population": "32000"}
]

You‚Äôre very close, but your example has a few syntax issues when compared strictly to the BNF grammar you provided. Let‚Äôs go through them step by step and then show a corrected version.

üß© 1. Dataset initialization

You wrote:

dataset cities = [
  {"name": "Falticeni", "population": "30000"}
  {"name": "Ludus", "population": "17000"}
  {"name": "Boholt", "population": "5000"}
  {"name": "Tandarei", "population": "32000"}
]


Issues:

According to <record_list> ::= <record> | <record> "," <record_list>,
each record must be separated by a comma ,.

According to <value> ::= <string> | <number>, population should be a number, not a quoted string.

‚úÖ Correct version:

dataset cities = [
  {"name": "Falticeni", "population": 30000},
  {"name": "Ludus", "population": 17000},
  {"name": "Boholt", "population": 5000},
  {"name": "Tandarei", "population": 32000}
]

üß© 2. Filter statement

You wrote:

filter cities where population > 20000


This matches perfectly:

<filter> ::= "filter" <id> "where" <condition>
<condition> ::= <expr> <comp_op> <expr>
<expr> ::= <field> | <value>


‚úÖ Valid.

üß© 3. Sort statement

You wrote:

sort cities desc


This also matches correctly:

<sort> ::= "sort" <id> <order>
<order> ::= "asc" | "desc"


‚úÖ Valid.

üß© 4. Select statement

You wrote:

select cities name


Let‚Äôs check the rule:

<select> ::= "select" <id> <field_list>


and

<field_list> ::= <field> | <field> "," <field_list>


So select cities name is valid only if name is a <field> ‚Äî and since <field> ::= <identifier>, it‚Äôs fine.

‚úÖ Valid.

üß© 5. Output statement

You wrote:

output cities


This matches:

<output> ::= "output" <id> ["to" <string>]


‚úÖ Valid.

‚úÖ Final corrected program

Putting it all together:

dataset cities = [
  {"name": "Falticeni", "population": 30000},
  {"name": "Ludus", "population": 17000},
  {"name": "Boholt", "population": 5000},
  {"name": "Tandarei", "population": 32000}
]

filter cities where population > 20000
sort cities desc
select cities name
output cities

üí° Summary
Statement	Valid	Notes
dataset cities = [...]	‚úÖ	Added commas + made population numeric
filter cities where population > 20000	‚úÖ	Correct
sort cities desc	‚úÖ	Correct
select cities name	‚úÖ	Correct
output cities	‚úÖ	Correct

So yes ‚Äî your logic and structure were correct, only minor syntax fixes (commas and numeric types) were needed for it to fully conform to the given BNF.

You said:
what about for this problem is it fine This program inputs a csv of foods which have fields for their calories, country of origin and name. First we filter them to only keep foods having calories greater than 750, followed by grouping them by country, sorting them, and outputting the foods if we have more than 10 countries where we have foods from. We then iterate over the food, and we output the name and the calories of the foods that have more than 1500 or less than 1000 calories.

input food from "food.csv"
filter food where calories > 750
group food by country
sort food asc
if count(food) > 10
  output food
end

for f in food
  if max(f.calories) > 1500 or min(f.calories) < 1000
    if len(f.name) > 10
      output f.name
      output f.calories
    end	
  end
end
ChatGPT said:

Excellent ‚Äî this is a great example to test your BNF.
Let‚Äôs go through it carefully and check each line for syntactic correctness and whether it follows the semantics implied by your grammar.

üß© 1. Input statement
input food from "food.csv"


Matches:

<input> ::= "input" <id> ["from" <string>]


‚úÖ Valid.

üß© 2. Filter
filter food where calories > 750


Matches:

<filter> ::= "filter" <id> "where" <condition>
<condition> ::= <expr> <comp_op> <expr>


‚úÖ Valid.

üß© 3. Group
group food by country


Matches:

<group> ::= "group" <id> "by" <field>


‚úÖ Valid.

üß© 4. Sort
sort food asc


Matches:

<sort> ::= "sort" <id> <order>
<order> ::= "asc" | "desc"


‚úÖ Valid.

üß© 5. If condition
if count(food) > 10
  output food
end


Let‚Äôs check the pieces:

count(food) fits <expr> ::= <function> "(" <id> ")".

> fits <comp_op>.

10 is <number>.

Block structure: if <condition> <statements> end ‚Äî your statements inside (output food) is valid.

‚úÖ Valid.

üß© 6. For loop
for f in food
  if max(f.calories) > 1500 or min(f.calories) < 1000
    if len(f.name) > 10
      output f.name
      output f.calories
    end	
  end
end


Let‚Äôs analyze part by part.

a) for f in food ... end

Matches:

<for> ::= "for" <id> "in" <id> <statements> "end"


‚úÖ Valid.

b) Inner if 1
if max(f.calories) > 1500 or min(f.calories) < 1000


max(f.calories) ‚Üí matches <expr> ::= <function> "(" <field> ")".

Same for min(f.calories).

or ‚Üí valid <logical_op>.
‚úÖ Valid.

c) Nested if 2
if len(f.name) > 10


len(f.name) fits <function> "(" <field> ")".
‚úÖ Valid.

d) Output lines
output f.name
output f.calories


According to the grammar:

<output> ::= "output" <id> ["to" <string>]


‚ùå Problem: f.name is a <field>, not an <id>.
Your grammar only allows <id> after output, not <field>.

So syntactically, output f ‚úÖ works,
but output f.name ‚ùå does not match the grammar as currently written.

üß© 7. Another small logic issue

Inside the for f in food loop, you‚Äôre using max(f.calories) and min(f.calories).
If f is a single record (not a group), calling max/min doesn‚Äôt make sense.
However, syntactically, it‚Äôs allowed ‚Äî because max is defined for <field>.
It‚Äôs only semantically questionable, not a syntax error.

‚úÖ Corrected (grammar-valid) version

Here‚Äôs how it should look if you want it to be 100% valid according to the BNF:

input food from "food.csv"
filter food where calories > 750
group food by country
sort food asc
if count(food) > 10
  output food
end

for f in food
  if max(f.calories) > 1500 or min(f.calories) < 1000
    if len(f.name) > 10
      output f
    end	
  end
end

üí° Optional: Extending the grammar

If your language should support output f.name (field-level output),
you could extend your grammar like this:

<output> ::= "output" (<id> | <field>) ["to" <string>]


That single change would make your original version fully valid.

‚úÖ Summary

Statement	Valid?	Notes
input food from "food.csv"	‚úÖ	Correct
filter food where calories > 750	‚úÖ	Correct
group food by country	‚úÖ	Correct
sort food asc	‚úÖ	Correct
if count(food) > 10 ‚Ä¶ end	‚úÖ	Correct
for f in food ‚Ä¶ end	‚úÖ	Correct
output f.name / f.calories	‚ö†Ô∏è	Not valid per current grammar (only <id> allowed)

So ‚Äî your program is almost perfect and semantically consistent,
just slightly outside the grammar‚Äôs definition for output.
