# 🎓 University Work

Welcome! Here you’ll find all the projects and coursework I completed during my university years at Babeș Bolyai University (BBU) in Cluj-Napoca, along with work from my Erasmus semester at Charles University (CUNI) in Prague. I hope you find it helpful and interesting!

**Note:** Grades are on a 10-point scale (10 = highest, 1 = lowest).
