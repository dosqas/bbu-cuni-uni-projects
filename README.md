# 🎓 University Work

Welcome! Here you’ll find all the projects and coursework I completed during my university years at Babeș-Bolyai University (BBU) in Cluj-Napoca, along with work from my Erasmus semester at Charles University (CUNI) in Prague. Each relevant computer science course also includes a brief description and the grade I achieved. I hope you find it helpful and interesting!  

**Note:** Grades are on a 10-point scale (10 = highest, 1 = lowest).
